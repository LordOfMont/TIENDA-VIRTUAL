# TIENDA-VIRTUAL
An e-commerce platform for some business, in this specific case I have done this for Benbol Ltda, for some issues this project won't be applied.
This project is also for a bachelor's course in Universidad Catolica Boliviana San Pablo, for the subject of INFORMATION SYSTEMS I, so prepare to read a lot of documentacion here.
I developed this with Angular and Bootstrap for the Front-End and PHP and MySQL for the Back-End.
